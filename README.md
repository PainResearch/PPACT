# PPACT
The PPACT (Pain Program for Active Coping and Training) study was a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial comparing a primary careâ€“embedded, interdisciplinary, behavioral intervention versus usual care for treating chronic pain among patients receiving long-term opioid therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02113592). The manuscript of the study's main outcomes is published in the Annals of Internal Medicine (https://doi.org/10.7326/M21-1436).
